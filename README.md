Todo App Practice is a simple and clean to-do list application built with Flutter.
It helps you manage your daily tasks with ease—create, update, mark as completed, or delete your tasks with just a few taps.

This app was created as part of a personal practice project to improve Flutter development skills, especially focusing on UI design, local storage, and state management.

The app runs on both Android and iOS platforms.
